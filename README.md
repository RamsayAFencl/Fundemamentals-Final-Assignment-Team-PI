# Fundemamentals-Final-Assignment-Team-PI

The calendar application that team PI developed allows for the user to manage an itinerary of events, including adding events that contain details and time information. Events can be deleted but not altered due to time constraints, as well as only being able to be deleted one at a time. The application stores all of the users events within the browser's local storage, meaning that the calendar can be closed and opened at any time while maintaining the saved informtaion. This means that the only way to fully reset the calendar would be to clear the local storage of the page from the browsers settings, this would be a feature in the app if not again due to time constraints. (If the user wants to maintain the calendar in its current state, while being able to freely clear browser settings it is suggested that they add the applications page to the browsers whitelist so it doesnt get cleared with the general file dump. Note that this is not a feature on all browsers!)

The status of the project is that it is in its final completed stage, though the feature set is incomplete in some areas, such as the cut to the calendars functionality of generating a weekly schedule based on event time information and classification. Besides this being the only major functionality cut to meet the deadline due to a lack of manpower on the project, the only minor functionalities missing are the options to mass delete events, sort events, and clear the calendars data from local storage.

The code was written mainly on one machine with finalized commits being posted here, commits to local repository are shown within the screenshot folder

To launch the web application, just open the index HTML file.
